Here, we provide a spatial multi-omics atlas of PDAC tumors from a series of immunotherapy neoadjuvant clinical trials. Intratumorally, pathologic responders exhibit mature TLS that propagate plasma cells into malignant niches. Our findings offer insights on the role of TLS-associated humoral immunity and stromal remodeling during immunotherapy treatment.
